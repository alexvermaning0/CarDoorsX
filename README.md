# Car_Doors
## A simple script that allows you to enter a vehicle by any of its doors.
I did not like that you needed to press an seperate key to activate it
so changed it to the default F key and removed the messages for a more seamless implementation 

**usage:**
just stand next to the door you want to enter and press F

SCRIPT ORIGINALLY CREATED BY ZAUB1 **THIS IS JUST A TRANSLATION/SLIGHT REWORK**
